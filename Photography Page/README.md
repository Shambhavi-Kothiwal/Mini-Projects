# Hamburger Menu (No JavaScript)

This mini-project demonstrates how to create a sliding hamburger menu using **only HTML and CSS**, avoiding the need for JavaScript altogether. It cleverly utilizes the `checkbox` hack in HTML to toggle the sidebar menu.

### 💡 Key Features

- Pure HTML + CSS implementation
- Responsive hamburger icon
- Sidebar navigation with smooth slide-in effect
- FontAwesome icons for enhanced UI

### 📁 Files Included

- `index.html` – HTML structure with a checkbox-based toggle
- `style.css` – Styling for the menu, transitions, layout, and responsiveness
- `photo.jpg` – Screenshot of the final result

### 🛠️ How It Works

The trick is based on:
- A hidden `<input type="checkbox">`
- Label tags acting as toggles for opening and closing the sidebar
- CSS selectors like `#check:checked ~ .sidebar_menu` for conditional styling

### 📚 Credits

Inspired by Apna College's CSS practice exercises.
