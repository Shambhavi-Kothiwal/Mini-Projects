## 🧠 Personal Challenge

The biggest **headscratcher** during this build was figuring out why there was still a small margin on mobile — even after using media queries. Eventually, I realized that some browsers (like Chrome) apply a default `8px` margin to the `<body>`. Once I removed that with `body { margin: 0; }`, the layout aligned perfectly.
